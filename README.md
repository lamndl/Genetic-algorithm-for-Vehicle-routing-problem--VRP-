# Genetic-algorithm-for-Vehicle-routing-problem--VRP
In the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP), the goal is to find optimal routes for multiple vehicles visiting a set of locations.
This algorithm presents an example of a VRP in which the goal is to minimize the longest customer's waiting time.
# Usage
1. run **vrp_data.py** to generate data set
2. run **vra.ipynb** to find the exact solution for small number of vertices and vehicles
3. run **vrp_ga.ipynb** to run genetic algorithm and data visualization tool
